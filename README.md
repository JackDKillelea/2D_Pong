# 2D_Pong
A pretty basic Pong replica. I made this just for a bit of fun to get used to Unity and learn the basics. Created in Unity using C#

This is a player vs player Pong game. It has everything that a basic Pong game should have, this includes: 

Paddles for both players
A ball that spawns and will go off in a random direction on load (and when someone scores)
Collision with the top and bottom bounds
Collision with the Paddles
When the ball goes behind a players Paddle the opposite player will score
When a ball hits the bounds or hits a players Paddle it will play a sound effect.

You play this game with two players, the left hand player will use the keys 'W' and 'S' and the right hand player will use the 'UP' arrow key and the 'DOWN' arrow key. 

There is currently no score limit, but the UI allows for you to score up to 999 before the text will become to big for the bounds. 

If you manage to play till one player gets to 999 then should you not be doing something more fun, like watching paint dry?
